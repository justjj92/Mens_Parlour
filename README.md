# Mens_Parlour
Mens Parlour is an app for a local barbershop. 
The user can book appoinments via in-app safari page, checkout the staff, shop products, view podcast via external webpage, check socials, and learn more about store operations. 

For Helpers:

This has 6 items in the LazyVGrid. My objective is to have them link to unique DetailViews such as 'StaffView', 'ShopView', and 'InfoView'. The other items would link to a web browser view. The 'book' item would bring up an in-app safariView using SFSafariViewWrapper and SafariServices. The 'pod' and 'social' would navigate to a webbrower outside the application using url.

I need to learn and figure out how to link and navigate the items in my LazyVGrid.

Any help is appreciated. 

Thanks,
Justin
